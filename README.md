# Currency Converter

A simple web application for converting currencies in real-time.

<!-- Plain-language overview for non-technical readers -->
This small website lets you type an amount of money, pick the currency you have (like USD) and the currency you want (like EUR), and then it shows you how much that amount is worth in the other currency. It looks up the latest exchange rates from a public service on the internet each time you click Convert.

## Features

- Convert between major world currencies
- Fetches live exchange rates
- Responsive and user-friendly interface

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- [Exchange Rate API](https://exchangerate-api.com/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

## Usage

## How it works (non-technical)

- The Reset button simply refreshes the page to clear everything.
